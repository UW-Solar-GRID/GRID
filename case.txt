User Story

Who? Solar panel specialist with technical experience. 
What do they want to do? Want to know specific components to prepare panels as well as cost
What needs and desires do they want for the tool? Want to input a location and wattage and get an output on the specifications of solar panels they need (e.g., surface area) and cost.
What is their skill level? Have an engineering background.

Use Case
User: Input both a location (lat, lon) and a wattage
Interface: [if a viable location] displays solar panel surface area, size/capacity components needed, average cost
           [if not location] display "Not a valid location. Try again."

Use Case: Retrieve solar irradiance
    What it does: finds the closest lat, lon to the input lat, lon
                  retrieves irradiance at that location
    Inputs: (lat,lon) (tuple of float)
    Outputs: Irradiance measurement (float)


Use Case: Find specs
    What it does: Produces necessary specifications for solar panel as well as size/capacity of components needed. Uses SAM model. 
    Input: Irradiance (float)
    Output: Panel specs (list of strings)


Use Case: Find cost
    What it does: Produce average cost for all components based on input data on current market market price
    Input: List of components (list of strings)
    Output: Price for each component (list of floats)


Use Case: Display
    What it does: Shows the user the component information and pricing estimate
    Input: Price for each component (list of floats) and panel specs (list of string) 
    Output: Display of the input
